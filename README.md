# React.js Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a React.js web application that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort in real-time. It's a fun and educational way to learn about sorting algorithms. The user is able to adjust the speed of the sorting process and read about how the algorithm works.



## Features

-  [x]  **Various Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Radix Sort

-  [x]  **Visualization**: You can see the sorting process visualized in real-time by 3D rendered bars. If it's going too fast, feel free to change the speed!

-  [x]  **Explanation**: Upon seeing the visualization, you also get a useful explanation how the algorithm works

-  [x]  **Comparison**: Besides the explanation, the user is able to compare the time and space complexity of the various algorithms
